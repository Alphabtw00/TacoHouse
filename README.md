"Expertly designed and developed 'Taco House,' a dynamic web application using Spring Boot 3.0, Spring MVC, and Thymeleaf to render HTML/CSS models from the server. Leveraged Spring Security and Spring JPA for robust authentication, authorization, and database management, integrating H-2 database for seamless data handling.

Implemented a comprehensive set of features including user registration, authentication, and profile management. The application facilitates menu browsing, allowing users to explore pre-made tacos or create customized orders. Additionally, users can submit reviews and benefit from CRUD functionalities for a seamless ordering experience.

Utilized Docker to create a portable and easily runnable environment for the application. Included a customized admin UI using Spring Actuator to handle metrics and monitor the application's health. Technologies employed include Spring Actuator for monitoring, management purposes, and admin interface for metrics.

This project showcases a mastery of Spring framework, database management, security implementation, Docker deployment, and monitoring tools, underscoring strong proficiency in full-stack development with Spring technologies.
